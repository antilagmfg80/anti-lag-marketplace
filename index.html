    <h1>ANTI-LAG MARKETPLACE</h1>

    <p>
    Anti-Lag Marketplace is a performance automotive commerce platform focused on
    precision, credibility, and long-term infrastructure over hype-driven sales.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Are Building</h2>
    <p>
    A curated e-commerce marketplace for performance automotive parts, vehicle builds,
    and enthusiast-driven commerce—designed to scale with trust, governance, and data.
    </p>

    <h2>Why It Exists</h2>
    <p>
    The performance aftermarket is fragmented, noisy, and often opaque. Anti-Lag exists
    to bring structure, accountability, and repeatability to how enthusiasts discover,
    evaluate, and purchase performance components.
    </p>

    <h2>Status</h2>
    <p>
    Infrastructure live. Marketplace architecture in development. Phased rollout underway.
    </p>
